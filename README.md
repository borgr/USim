# USim
monolingual sentence similarity measure

Please cite our NAACL2018 paper if you use our measure.

As USim uses currently the TUPA parser it should be installed
`pip install tupa`

Usage example:
python USim.py parse out.out -ss "I love rusty spoons", "nothing matters" -rs "he shares pretty cars", "nothing indeed"
